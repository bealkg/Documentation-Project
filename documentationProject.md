## Introduction
The app 2048 is a single-player video game. The puzzle game has sliding tiles with different powers of 2. When two tiles with the same number are slid into one another, they combine into the next power of two. The goal of the game is to get the 2048 tile, or combine tiles of 2 11 times.
## Installation
2048 is available on Web browser, iOS, and Android. Many more downloads of the game exist, but they are not the original version and should be downloaded and used with caution. 

Web Browser
>To use 2048 on a web browser, go to the following [link][p].

iOS
>To download 2048 on iOS, search 2048 in the Apple App store.

Android
>To download 2048 on Android, search 2048 on the Android app store. 

## Instructions
To play 2048, on the web browser, use the arrow keys to move the blocks on the screen. If on Android or iOS, swipe the screen to move the blocks. The goal is to combine the generated blocks into the 2048 block by moving matching numbers into one another. The game will generate 2 and 4 blocks with every move. Use the blocks generated to create bigger numbers. The game will end when the screen is full and none of the block can combine. Good Luck!

## FAQ
I got the 2048 block. Now what?
> Congrats! You can keep playing and combine to even higher numbers.

How high do the numbers go?
> Theoretically, 131072 is possible, but unlikely because the board is limited to only 16 squares. To get 131072, the board would need 65536, 32768, 16384, 8192, 4096, 2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 4, which would fill the entire 16 squares.
