## FAQ
I got the 2048 block. Now what?
> Congrats! You can keep playing and combine to even higher numbers.

How high do the numbers go?
> Theoretically, 131072 is possible, but extremely unlikely because the board is limited to only 16 squares. To get 131072, the board would need 65536, 32768, 16384, 8192, 4096, 2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 4, which would fill the entire 16 squares.
